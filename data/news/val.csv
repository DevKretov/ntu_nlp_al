think whole effort misguided reread paul doubt free anything christians criterion use making judgments great commandment love god neighbor cannot go leviticus decide command basis arbitrary selection simply idiosyncracy context remarkably offensive say notice verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows verse prohibiting appears homosexual intercourse sorry found offensive intent offend leading another point discuss detail well latida almost slimey argument one homosexuality rape know one argues seriously though one always find jokers defense bestiality absolutely irrelevant incomparable issues gay christians raise concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships bringing relevant laws kashrut cannot address actual issues bloody dishonest trailing red herring front world want address bestiality business mine attempting torpedo serious issue using culture ridiculous joke shows interest hearing us human beings want dismiss us use sleaziest means think see revulsion bestiality far exceeds distaste homosexuality certainly spoke homosexuality way speak bestiality nobody would trouble labelling homophobe let ask gently judgemental peoples sexual preferences happened doubt free anything think serious double standard describe comparison homosexuality bestiality slimey sleazy making implicit judgement bestiality perverted sinful disgusting unnaturalin short things society thought homosexuality people share view claim know sincere zoophiles mean exist even newsgroup altsexbestiality going accuse mere jokers notice deleted main point comment fact biblical condemnations bestiality occur connection levitical prohibitions homosexuality new testament passages arguably taken condemning homosexuality none condemn bestiality one main points seems christian homosexuality acceptable due lack clear new testament statements valid argument christian zoophilia made much acceptable fact new testament makes reference clear unclear subject quite serious going accept homosexuality biblically acceptable basis arguments going fair apply standards everyone elses declared sexual preferences well arguments make homosexuality applied sexual preferences well im going apply see comes im trying torpedo serious issue using label ridiculous joke posted question interpret biblical guidelines christian sexuality dont think question irrelevant group called socreligionchristian bible discusses homosexuality bestiality together context therefore feel good precedent jesus paul expound explictly considerable length central linchpin christian moral thought required love one another else depends gay lesbian christ ians challenge address issue terms get return cheap debate tricks attempting sidetrack issues dont know whether makes difference record side issue believe loving one another includes encouraging people defile therefore high importance determine whether god regards certain sexual acts defiling read new testament god joined together heterosexual couples marriage bed undefiled read old testament homosexual intercourse bestiality defile person whether person law gay christians validly put aside old testament standards defilement want know fairly apply sexual practices defiled person old days dont think right take bits pieces law try apply christians today eg bestiality still defiles homosexuality doesnt pretty much said earlier right used different examples think said essentially thing wrong apply certain parts law christians christians doubt sincere ones keep showing every corner usenet world ever spout old verses obviously never thought maybe never even read total ignorance issues raised slandering us vilest charges child abuse whatever perfervid minds manage conjure tossing red herrings suppose great emotional force cause readers dismiss witness without even taking trouble find intent stir emotional reaction personally dont get upset discussing alternatives monogamous heterosexual orientation im afraid naively assumed others would similar attitude please note never intended equate homosexuality child abuse merely noted lack clear nt condemnation homosexuality even greater lack nt condemnation even mention bestiality practice number people eg altsexbestiality consider true sexual orientation behavior shame anyone claims seen truth christ gods precious sake people quote irrelevant verses condemn people dont know wont even take trouble listen start condemnations loving neighbor god forbid obey repeated commands judge condemn others christ paul spend orders magnitude time insisting halfdozen obscure words paul bloody ready take license god tells gods sake quote john ff omitted brevity excellent question pray treat mere rhetorical question genuinely seek discover understand answer recommend begin little introspection much attitude towards zoophilia find bestiality repugnant regard slanderous even mention connection alternative sexual orientations apply verses love tolerance zoophiles way apply homosexuals automatically experience subjective feeling revulsion thought lot people experience thought homosexual intercourse regard practice socially unacceptable lot people regard homosexuality socially unacceptable feel violates traditional judeochristian standard sexual morality many people feel homosexuality feel bible condemns many people think bible says condemn homosexuality condemn bestiality think comparing bestiality homosexuality insulting homosexuality honestly answer question come long way towards understanding many people feel way homosexuality feel bestiality also please note sense condemning people merely pointing read bible see certain sexual practices bible appears condemn eg sex outside marriage say think adultery premarital sex sinful take failing love neighbor treat bestiality something disgusting unmentionable disobeying repeated orders judge condemn others say christians guilty sinning condemning judging accusation making guilty offense simply taking note practices bible brands sinful leaving judgement people god long ages many us confused evil counsel evil men told came light would shamed rejected us despaired took courses probably show sinful shunning gods light blessed whose spirits crushed selfrighteous shall justified however seen truth truth light humanity know fear light enemies fear light witness everything shadow darkness false witness us michael l siemon say gods sons high nevertheless shall die like men fall com like prince psalm im sure mean two paragraphs mean jesus truth accepts sinners reject agree sinners would need savior salvation christ however mean sin irrelevant us whatever want christs grace mean refer sin sin judgemental intolerant speaking general terms specifically homosexuality bible calls something sin unreasonable christians call sin applied christian homosexuality think definitive authority christian sexuality bible make list everything bible says subject homosexual intercourse think find every verse list negative condemning worst unclear best progay statement could make list dispute new testament verses many people interpret condemning homosexual intercourse gay perspective positive thing say bibles treatment homosexuality verses fail clearly condemn thats jesus declared foods clean council jerusalem declared gentiles required keep ritual law nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse abomination deserving death accepted christian practice verses describing homosexual intercourse abomination defiles jews law gentiles law verses best clear people believe clear condemnation homosexual behavior thats sum total bible says samesex intercourse appreciate personal experience desire everything simple cutanddried blackandwhite whatiwant isok thosewhoopposemearewicked however think bible makes case definitively would like fact dont believe says anything positive case yes know verses loving one another judging one another thats really issue know admit still things sinful christians since say wrong christians condemn therefore issue whether bible says homosexual intercourse sin even challenge clarity new testament verses still left fact thing bible say clearly homosexual intercourse abomination defiles law mark actually dont think reaction comparision bestiality based bestialophobia think regards slimey rhetorical approach connecting homosexuality bestiality people accept homosexuality take radical approach law regard lev binding christians argument theres way text separate bestiality homosexuality wearing mixed fabrics

grafted gentiles roma says adoption glory covenants giving law service god promises belong israelites explanation paul makes clear born israel enough israel israel v gal says ye christs ye abrahams seed heirs according promise christians abrahams seed jews israelites physically criterion spiritually joint heirs jesus based promise god made people israelites christians agree ot laws apply us part specific covenanent jews also expect see similarity things god expected jews things expects us god however several ways dealing days common approach separate ot commandments moral ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply jews part specific mosaic covenant thinsg like kosher laws circumcision moral laws apply everyone commands part moral law except commandment sabbath believe people take approach would say specific requirement worship sabbath part ceremonial law general obligation worship regularly part general moral law thus christians free choose specific time worship people would probably agree wrong sabbath commandment ceremonial part law predates ceremonial laws free choose time worship even follow day worship origins pagan sun worship would rather give day god blessed sanctified hallowed exchange one church leaders agree biblical foundation see sabbath admissions socreligionchristianbiblestudy radical approach generally connected john calvin reformed tradition says law whole longer binding instead entirely grace behavior guided solely love portions ot law still useful guidance properly speaking legally binding us practice people take position believe safe leave christians without moral guidannce may longer law sinners safe us go situations principles guide us good selfjustification safe thus christians moral guidance things like jesus teachings pauls advice etc may precisely law serve much function largely content moral law previous analysis calvin would deny fixed legal responsibility worship specific day would say given human weakness discipline regular worship important care calvin theologian says guide god says law means keep law section law trouble sabbath commandment one god thought important enough say remember study word deeply note message longer condemnation law freed grace god cop pulls speeding court ask mercy judge throw book gives grace walk court saying go speeding grace grace drive within speed limit paul adds rom di make void law faith god forbid yea establish law wherefore law holy commandment holy good rom analyses specific day issue matter tradition worship sunday memorial christs resurrection theres debate acts shows early christian worship common analysis shows jewish christians continuing go jewish services sabbath specifically christian service necessarily held act shows worship first day sunday cor also implies gatherings day groups continue believe christians worship sabbath saturday bestknown seventhday adventists jehovahs witnesses argue act regular worship service special meeting see paul cor doesnt explicitly say regular worship service prefer implication fact careful study acts shows meeting saturday night sunday morning paul go worship service set long journey foot assos icor way equate lay store go worship service clear issue contested one pauls time see rom pauls advice careful judging issues like one person sees specific day mandated god another observes specific day honor lord believes worship free restrictions also honor lord believe sabbath still mandated argue paul referring sabbath worship note however col says something similar briefer explicitly mentions sabbath wrong sabbath days ceremonial law sabbath day moral law differences among christians use word sabbath originally term referred th day jewish day worship many christians use refer sunday day christian worship largely apply th whatever couple different numbering schemes commandment reformed tradition distinguishes sabbath observance mandated jews lords day free christian worship reference find nt rev also differences laws regarding day many christians support blue laws secular law church law setting aside day causing people spend worship radical antilegal approach sees regulations return jewish sabbath appropriate free christian worship lords day would prefer twist turn relying different arguments conflict rather obey simple request god loved enough die jesus died law could changed bother die order meet demands broken law need change law penalties law breaking means law immutable sin follow demands ceremonial laws always sin make false gods violate gods name break sabbath steal kill etc except disagree opinion weight placed next word god darius clear much needs said faq think pauls comments esteeming one day another rom probably needs said accept darius honor lord wish might equally accept esteem days alike similarly best honor lord however id like clear think theres unambiguous proof regular christian worship first day indicated responses passages cited difficulty passages actually something else look like talking nnregular christian meetings neither explicitly says gathered every sunday worship get various pieces information nothing aimed answering question act describes christians participating jewish temple worship christian communion services homes obviously temple worship sabbath acts example christians participating unfortunately doesnt tell us day christians met houses acts despite darius confusion described acts occuring sunday see reason impose modern definitions days start biblical text clear meant wording implies normal meeting doesnt say gathered see paul gathered breaking bread paul talked upcoming travel thats explicit enough really convincing similarly cor says first day set aside money pauls collection want believe gathered specially homes cant disprove obvious time congregation take offering would normally gather worship expected homes would reason mention specific day think obvious reading first day every week simply means every time gather worship think reason implications clear statements nt authors assumed readers knew christian worship clh

original mcconkie clearly stated elohim father speaking jehovah son psalm however one looks hebrew word translated lord becomes apparent either first lord father else father jehovah either way mcconkie wrong psalm reads lord jehovah said unto lord adon sit thou right hand make thine enemies thy footstool ps first lord verse jehovah mormonism says christ father second lord hebrew word adon singular adonai meaning master lord first lord father second lord son father jehovah son adon however father jehovah mcconkie claimed first lord jehovah son adon obviously father jehovah psalm son adon another example involves isa mcconkie stated following lord called thee righteousness isaiah quoted father saying christ hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie said father speaking christ passage reads lord jehovah called thee righteousness hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa according mcconkie lord refers father thine thee refer christ however lord speaking jehovah means either mcconkie wrong speaking else father jehovah another example involves ps verses mcconkie stated

saved others cannot save king israel let come cross believe trusted god let deliver said son god thieves also crucified cast teeth matt promised messiah pp emphasis added ps reads follows see laugh

art priest ever order melchizedek ps lord jehovah refer christ mcconkie right jesus jehovah father lord would refer christ one addressed priest forever order melchizedek bible reveals one referred jesus christ heb therefore lord jehovah ps father another example involves isa verses mcconkie stated atoning sacrifice future messiah isaiah said lord laid iniquities us pleased lord bruise promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie rightly said verses refer atoning sacrifice future messiah however failed mention also prove father jehovah verse reads like sheep gone astray turned every one way lord jehovah hath laid christ iniquity us verse reads yet pleased lord jehovah bruise christ obviously lord laid christ iniquity us bruised god father called jehovah verses remember mcconkie stated

following truly lord act mortal ministry truly written shall stand feed strength lord majesty name lord god shall great unto ends earth mic promised messiah p emphasis added according mcconkie pronoun beginning mic refers christ mortal ministry lord god mic reads christ shall stand feed strength lord jehovah majesty name lord jehovah god elohim shall great unto ends earth obviously lord jesus

alt,constructing logical argument although much argument usenet general quality argument found poor article attempts provide gentle introduction logic hope improving general level debate logic science reasoning proof thinking inference concise oed logic allows us analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct valid invalid course one need study logic order reason correctly nevertheless little basic knowledge logic often helpful constructing analyzing argument note claim made whether logic universally applicable matter much open debate document merely explains use logic given already decided logic right tool job propositions statements building blocks logical argument proposition statement either true false example raining today tuesday propositions may either asserted said true denied said false note technical meaning deny everyday meaning proposition meaning statement particular arrangement words used express god exists exists god express proposition argument quote monty python sketch connected series statements establish definite proposition argument consists three stages first propositions necessary argument continue stated called premises argument evidence reasons accepting argument conclusions premises assertions often indicated phrases since obviously phrase obviously often viewed suspicion used intimidate others accepting suspicious premises something doesnt seem obvious dont afraid question always say oh yes youre right obvious youve heard explanation next premises used derive propositions process known inference inference one proposition arrived basis one propositions already accepted various forms valid inference propositions arrived inference may used inference inference often denoted phrases implies therefore finally arrive conclusion argument proposition affirmed basis premises inference conclusions often indicated phrases therefore follows conclude conclusion often stated final stage inference example every event cause premise universe beginning premise beginnings involve event premise implies beginning universe involved event inference therefore universe cause inference conclusion note conclusion one argument might premise another argument proposition called premise conclusion respect particular argument terms make sense isolation sometimes argument follow order given example conclusions might stated first premises stated afterwards support conclusion perfectly valid sometimes little confusing recognizing argument much harder recognizing premises conclusions many people shower writing assertions without ever producing anything one might reasonably describe argument statements look like arguments example bible accurate jesus must either insane evil liar son god argument conditional statement assert premises necessary support appears conclusion also suffers number logical flaws well come later another example god created therefore duty god phrase duty god proposition since neither true false therefore conclusion sentence argument finally causality important consider statement form b interested establishing b offered evidence statement argument trying establish truth b argument explanation example must something wrong engine car start argument car start something wrong engine explanation two traditional types argument deductive inductive deductive argument one provides conclusive proof conclusions argument premises true conclusion must also true deductive argument either valid invalid valid argument defined one premises true conclusion true inductive argument one premises provide evidence truth conclusion inductive arguments valid invalid however talk whether better worse arguments probable premises forms argument ordinary language neither deductive inductive however concentrate moment deductive arguments often viewed rigorous convincing important note fact deductive argument valid imply conclusion holds slightly counterintuitive nature implication must consider carefully obviously valid argument consist true propositions however argument may entirely valid even contains false propositions example insects wings premise woodlice insects premise therefore woodlice wings conclusion conclusion true arguments premises false arguments premises true however conclusion would true argument thus entirely valid subtly reach true conclusion one false premises fish live sea premise dolphins fish premise therefore dolphins live sea conclusion however one thing cannot reach false conclusion valid inference true premises therefore draw truth table implication symbol denotes implication premise b conclusion f represent true false respectively premise conclusion inference b ab f f premises false inference f valid conclusion true false f f premises true conclusion false inference must invalid premises true inference valid conclusion must true sound argument valid argument whose premises true sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion careful confuse valid arguments sound arguments delve structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy simpler probably useful summarize major pitfalls avoided constructing argument pitfalls known fallacies everyday english term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well faulty reasoning leads beliefs fair enough logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument especially argument appears valid convincing purposes discussion define fallacy logical argument appears correct seen incorrect examined closely studying fallacies aim avoid misled following list fallacies intended exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal force appeal force committed arguer resorts force threat force order try push acceptance conclusion often used politicians summarized might makes right force threatened need direct threat arguer example thus ample proof truth bible refuse accept truth burn hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem literally argument directed man abusive variety argumentum ad hominem occurs instead trying disprove truth assertion arguer attacks person people making assertion invalid truth assertion depend upon goodness asserting example atheism evil philosophy practised communists murderers sometimes court law doubt cast upon testimony witness showing example known perjurer valid way reducing credibility testimony given witness argumentum ad hominem however demonstrate witnesss testimony false conclude otherwise fall victim argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere list circumstantial form argumentum ad hominem committed person argues opponent ought accept truth assertion opponents particular circumstances example perfectly acceptable kill animals food argue otherwise youre quite happy wear leather shoes abusive charge inconsistency used excuse dismissing opponents argument fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion example course would argue positive discrimination bad thing youre white particular form argumentum ad hominem one alleges ones adversary rationalizing conclusion formed selfish interests also known poisoning well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument ignorance fallacy occurs whenever argued something must true simply proved false equivalently argued something must false proved true note assuming something false proved true basic scientific principle examples course bible true nobody prove otherwise course telepathy psychic phenomena exist nobody shown proof real note fallacy apply court law one generally assumed innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation known event would produce certain evidence occurred absence evidence validly used infer event occur example flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice poles therefore flood occurred science validly assume lack evidence something occurred cannot conclude certainty occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam appeal pity also known special pleading fallacy committed arguer appeals pity sake getting conclusion accepted example murder mother father axe please dont find guilty im suffering enough orphan argumentum ad populum known appealing gallery appealing people commit fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion appealing large group people form fallacy often characterized emotive language example pornography must banned violence women bible must true millions people know trying tell mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram fallacy closely related argumentum ad populum consists asserting people support believe proposition likely proposition correct argumentum ad verecundiam appeal authority uses admiration famous try win support assertion example isaac newton genius believed god line argument always completely bogus example reference admitted authority particular field may relevant discussion subject example distinguish quite clearly stephen hawking concluded black holes give radiation john searle concluded impossible build intelligent computer hawking physicist reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed searle linguist questionable whether wellqualified speak subject machine intelligence fallacy accident fallacy accident committed general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean rule inapplicable error made one goes general specific example christians generally dislike atheists christian must dislike atheists fallacy often committed moralists legalists try decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization fallacy reverse fallacy accident occurs one forms general rule examining specific cases representative possible cases example jim bakker insincere christian therefore christians insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs general rule applied particular situation features particular situation render rule inapplicable sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc known false cause fallacies fallacy non causa pro causa occurs one identifies something cause event actually shown cause example took aspirin prayed god headache disappeared god cured headache fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs something assumed cause event merely happened event example soviet union collapsed taking atheism therefore must avoid atheism reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts two events occur together must causally related leaves room factors may causes events petitio principii fallacy occurs premises least questionable conclusion reached circulus demonstrando fallacy occurs one assumes premise conclusion one wishes reach often proposition rephrased fallacy appears valid argument example homosexuals must allowed hold government office hence government official revealed homosexual lose job therefore homosexuals anything hide secret open blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government office note argument entirely circular premise conclusion argument like actually cited reason british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example classic know god exists bible tells us know bible true word god complex question fallacy interrogation fallacy presupposition one example classic loaded question stopped beating wife question presupposes definite answer another question even asked trick often used lawyers crossexamination ask questions like hide money stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions long ec interference affairs allowed continue chancellor plan two years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming argument supports particular conclusion actually logically nothing conclusion example christian may begin saying argue teachings christianity undoubtably true argues length christianity great help many people matter well argues shown christian teachings true sadly fallacious arguments often successful arouse emotions cause others view supposed conclusion favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs key word used two different meanings argument example could affordable free software make sure remains free users like must place license make sure always freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs premises used argument ambiguous careless ungrammatical phrasing accent accent another form fallacy shifting meaning case meaning changed altering parts statement emphasized example consider speak ill friends speak ill friends fallacies composition one fallacy composition conclude property shared parts something must apply whole example bicycle made entirely low mass components therefore lightweight fallacy composition conclude property number individual items shared collection items example car uses less petrol causes less pollution bus therefore cars less environmentally damaging buses fallacy division fallacy division opposite fallacy composition like opposite exists two varieties first assume property thing must apply parts example studying rich college therefore must rich assume property collection items shared item example ants destroy tree therefore ant destroy tree slippery slope argument argument states one event occur harmful events proof made harmful events caused first event example legalize marijuana would legalize crack heroin well nation full drugaddicts welfare therefore cannot legalize marijuana based b fallacies type fallacies fallacies occur one attempts argue things way similar without actually specifying way similar examples isnt history based upon faith isnt bible also form history islam based faith christianity based faith isnt islam form christianity cats form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form animal based carbon chemistry arent dogs form cat affirmation consequent fallacy argument form implies b b true therefore true understand fallacy examine truth table implication given earlier denial antecedent fallacy argument form implies b false therefore b false truth table implication makes clear fallacy note fallacy different non causa pro causa latter form implies b false therefore b false fact imply b problem implication invalid rather falseness allow us deduce anything b converting conditional fallacy argument form b therefore b argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something right good simply old thats way always argumentum ad novitam opposite argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something correct simply new newer something else argumentum ad crumenam fallacy believing money criterion correctness money likely right argumentum ad lazarum fallacy assuming someone poor sounder virtuous one wealthier fallacy opposite argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam incorrect belief assertion likely true often heard argumentum ad nauseum one employs constant repetition asserting something bifurcation also referred black white fallacy bifurcation occurs one presents situation two alternatives fact alternatives exist exist plurium interrogationum many questions fallacy occurs questioner demands simple answer complex question non sequitur nonsequitur argument conclusion drawn premises logically connected red herring fallacy committed irrelevant material introduced issue discussed everyones attention diverted away points made towards different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs abstract concept treated concrete thing shifting burden proof burden proof always person making assertion proposition shifting burden proof special case argumentum ad ignorantium fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion made source fallacy assumption something true unless proven otherwise straw man straw man fallacy misrepresent someone elses position attacked easily knock misrepresented position conclude original position demolished fallacy fails deal actual arguments made extended analogy fallacy extended analogy often occurs suggested general rule argued fallacy assume mentioning two different situations argument general rule constitutes claim situations analogous fallacy best explained using real example debate anticryptography legislation believe always wrong oppose law breaking position odious implies would supported martin luther king saying cryptography legislation important struggle black liberation dare tu quoque famous fallacy occurs action argued acceptable party performed

soc,someone referred faq essay homosexuality since hasnt posted time ive modified somewhat since last time im taking opportunity post another entry faq containing comments contributors retrieved ftprutgersedu pubsocreligionchristianothershomosexuality contains far detail exegetical issues give though primarily conservative point view posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality christians frequently asked question post question time occurs rather attempt summarize postings get discussion summarizes arguments allowing christian homosexuality since people asking question already know arguments common question dealt herein christian justify homosexual given bible says first definition homosexual many groups believe homosexual orientation ie sexual attraction members sex distinguished actual homosexual sexual activity homosexuals abstain sex considered groups acceptable however lot discussion term homosexual means someone actually engaging homosexual sex generally accepted outside liberal groups paper im going use homosexual meaning person engaging sexual acts another sex havent heard biblical argument person homosexual orientation remains celebate think people admit predisposition homosexual often called homosexual orientation known whether genetic environmental evidence suggesting best evidence ive seen homosexuality single phenomenon number different causes one probably genetic several groups try help people move homosexual heterosexual bestknown exodus international reports ive seen havent read detailed literature summary minority opinion presbyterian churchs infamous report human sexuality suggest programs low success rates questions real even successes certainly people say converted however issue important sounds believe homosexuality wrong believe intrinsically wrong defined god fact hard get homosexual relevant fact hard escape drug addict wrong wrong may affect deal people though difficult change may tend make us willing forgive one general background issue common quote figure population homosexual asked one experts came heres response kinsey see source figure percent defines sexuality behavior orientation ranked persons scale zero completely heterosexual completely heterosexual according kinsey onethird male adults least one experience orgasm homosexually post puberty ten percent adult males experiences homosexually percentages held true followup study done kinsey institute based data early seventies published early bell weinberg believe cant put hand latter reference online information kinseys study appears iris catalog rutgers author kinsey alfred charles title sexual behavior human male alfred c kinsey wardell b pomeroy clyde e martin publisher philadelphia w b saunders co descrip xv p diagrs cm notes based surveys made members staff indiana university supported national research councils committee research problems sex means funds contributed medical division rockefeller foundation bibliography p aut pomeroy wardell baxter joint author martin clyde eugene joint author subjects sex u moral conditions lc card figure widely used scholarly discussions even found hold true several cultures noted recent newsweek coverstory child gay feb journalist running rounds talk shows season promoting book allegedly refutes kinseys study scholarly world seems take kook ive seen objections kinseys study enough detail include someone would like contribute another view id willing include christians believe homosexuality least genital sex wrong however denominations accept metropolitan community churches bestknown formed specifically accept homosexuals however united church christ also allows think couple groups may well episcopal church seems accept areas others churches congregational government youll find congregations accept even among southern baptists though number probably one two congregations unusual churches permit homosexual church leaders carefully enforce another issue dont doubt homosexual pastors every denomination open others arguments biblical issues heres attempt summarize issues commonly cited reference favoring acceptance homosexuality previous discussions john boswell christianity social tolerance homosexuality u chicago press argument pretty clear several explicit laws ot eg leviticus rom paul seems pretty negative homosexuality beyond references debates passages often cited subject probably relevant eg sin inhabitants sodom proposed carry homosexual rape homosexual activity consenting adults theres even question whether homosexual since entities involved angels particularly horrifying involved guests responsibility towards guests culture strong probably reason lot offered daughter better give daughter allow guests attacked look concordance references sodom elsewhere bible youll see seem imply homosexuality sin theres jewish interpretive tradition major sin abuse guests rate theres debate homosexual rape wrong discuss leviticus law part set laws christians consider binding unless nt justification found lev alone would settle issue nt references pauls letters number references paul lists sins words fairly vague boswell argues words occuring lists mean homosexual heres says two greek words appear lists ie cor tim malakos arsenokoitai unfortunately entirely clear words actually mean malakos basic meaning soft variety metaphorical meanings ethical writing boswell suggests wanton likely equivalent also reports unanimous interpretation church including greekspeaking christians passage referred masturbation meaning vanished th cent practice come less frownedupon cites references late edition catholic encyclopedia identify masturbation translates arsenokotai male prostitute giving evidence none church fathers understood term referring homosexuality general technical meaning suggested early latin translations would active mode homosexual male prostitute view paul intend technically conservative view consulted gordon fees commentary cor cites evidence malakos often meant effeminate however boswell warns us greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual though may associated kinds homosexual behavior given boswell fee say taken together suspect term simply definite applies homosexuals cases isnt general term homosexuality fee argues boswell arsenokotai well ends suggesting translation seems essentially big problem word almost never used pauls writing first occurence fact word clearly composed male fk unfortunately doesnt quite tell us meaning since doesnt tell us whether male subject object action examples compound words formed either way given theory could refer rapists etc dangerous base meaning purely etymology youll conclude goodbye religious expression based god ye however since boswell fee niv seem agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess note translation misses strong vulgarity term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest nt reference homosexuality romans boswell points rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual however find argument somewhat forced fact homosexual readers seriously proposed paul meant however convinced rom sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describing rom homosexuality among christians homosexuality appeared among idolaters one part whole package wickedness despite impression left impassioned rhetoric im sure paul believe pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex given description situation rather assume heterosexual sex would also debased shameless yes believe passage indicates negative view homosexuality fairness shameless nature acts reflection general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality overall view situation following think enough evidence confident paul disapproved homosexuality rom seems clear cor tim unambiguous general condemnations homosexuality seem like wording would come someone approved homosexuality even considered acceptable cases hand none passages contains explicit teachings subject rom really idolatry refers homosexuality passing result situation people interpret passages light general approach scripture look scripture laws issues surprising would consider passages nt endorsement ot prohibition whose approach bible liberal surprising regard pauls negative view homosexuality something took jewish upbringing without serious reexamination light gospel readers group know assumptions behind approaches radically different people tend foam mouth see opposing view described theres lot moderator situation number discussions past centered around sort detailed exegesis texts described however fact im convinced defenders homosexuality actually base beliefs analyses real issue seems rest question whether pauls judgement apply modern homosexuality one commonly made claim paul simply never faced kinds questions trying deal encountered homosexuality contexts people would probably agree wrong never faced experience christians try act straight fail never faced christians trying define christian homosexuality fits general christian ideals fidelity seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take pauls judgement homosexuality among idolaters use make judgements questions another following pauls time homosexuality associated number things christians would find acceptable part temple prostitution among private citizens often occured adults children free people slaves im position say always reasons think ancients distinguished active passive partner considered disgraceful free adult act passive partner reason active mode homosexual prostitute would considered disgraceful customers would people enjoyed passive role supports idea would tend engaged two free adult males least without degree scandal clearly christian homosexuals would condone sex children slaves others position fully responsible partners however fees commentary cor cites examples ancient literature homosexual relationships seem involve free adults reasonably symmetrical way thus considerations paragraph shouldnt pushed far homosexuality may discredited jews associations surely must cases prostitutes involve slaves children people argued aids judgement homosexuality id like point aids transmitted promiscuous sex homosexual heterosexual someone homosexual relationship meets christian criteria marriage risk aids note good reason pauls general approach doubt would concede homosexuality fully equal alternative apart specific statements homosexuality believe use genesis story would lead regard heterosexual marriage god ordained however way paul deals pastoral questions provides warning quick deal issue legally claim question counsel homosexual christians entirely theological issue also pastoral one pauls tendency see issues eating meat celebrating holidays uncompromising principle pastoral issues look carefully good people involved avoid insisting perfection would personally damaging example paul clearly believed acceptable eat meat wanted us avoid pushing people action personal qualms another example paul obviously would preferred see people least circumstances remain unmarried yet unable certainly would rather see married state might tempted fornication believe one could take view like even accepting views paul expressed rom one may believe homosexuality god intended occured result sin still conclude times live note creation story work enters human life result sin doesnt mean christians stop working saved question whether believe homosexuality sinful whether believe misfortune broad sense due human sinfulness youre willing consider latter approach becomes pastoral judgement whether damage caused finding way live trying cure dangers trying cure attempt often fails end damage ranging psychological damage suicide well broken marriages attempts living heterosexual fail going depend upon ones assessment inherent nature homosexuality believe serious wrong may willing run high risks serious damage get rid clearly generally suggest people live tendency steal drug addiction even though attempts cure conditions also difficult however conditions intrinsically damaging way obvious homosexuality many problems associated homosexuality actually problems promiscuity homosexuality includes aids take granted sort homosexual relationships christian would consider allowing would equivalent christian heterosexual relationships course discussing last decade weve heard lot personal testimony fellow christians situation ive also seen summaries various research results various efforts conversion aside presbyterian report mentioned theres faq summarizes readers reports question evidence longterm success changing orientation rare enough par healing miracles danger advising christians depend upon change clear conversion doesnt happen almost always people often left despair feeling excluded church nothing say requirement lifelong celibacy paul recognized though different context demand practical people think history clerical celibacy strongly reinforced judgement practical result homosexuals end gay sex clubs rest sordid side homosexuality maybe homosexuality isnt gods original ideal well imagine paul preferring see people longterm committed christian relationships promiscuity work genesis suggests wasnt part gods original ideal either think relationships still vehicle people sharing gods love theres issue biblical interpretation underlying discussion issue cultural relativism paul says something wrong taken eternal statement things wrong specific situations culture time conservative christians generally insist taking prohibitions absolute since otherwise bible becomes subjective stop us considering everything relative looking issue worth noting one completely rejects concept cultural relativism number judgements new testament even conservative christians consider relative following judgements least clear bible anything said homosexuality prohibition charging interest occurs times ot nt mention relatively recently church consider binding christians prohibition swearing oaths endorsement slavery institution judgement tax collectors sinner regard items binding cases believe argument essentially one cultural relativism briefly prohibition interest appropriate specific agrarian society bible trying build market economy people believe american judicial oaths characteristics kind oaths jesus concerned people believe paul simply telling people live within slavery endorsing institution people believe irs morally equivalent roman tax farming point im trying make applying biblical prohibitions th cent need look whether th cent actions christian homosexuals say relationships different greek homosexuality paul would familiar exactly kind argument made judicial oaths tax collectors fairly recently christians prohibited taking interest many christians regarded slavery divinely endorsed indeed slavery one common metaphors relationship god human beings christians often called servants slaves god trying say everything bible culturally relative rather im trying say things therefore enough say something appears bible ends discussion need look whether action talking moral implications one bible talking christians want argue reasons think prohibitions homosexuality still binding im willing listen claim question doesnt need looked kidding unless part small minority really obey rules listed one thing worries great emotions issue creates consider weakness biblical evidence laws leviticus passage rom whose subject matter really idolatry rather homosexuality couple lists whose words ambiguous amount concern raising among christians seems rather proportion suggest people reasons simply biblical involved true sides clearly homosexual christians strongly motivated find ways discrediting biblical arguments conservative christians find biblical arguments cant help feeling bible used sides way justifying attitudes come sources dangerous situation christians side issue would like note problems prohomosexual position commonly presented one common arguments homosexuality biologically determined ie god made homosexual choice think god made homosexual fine view people already believe grounds homosexuality acceptable dont see argument acceptability many people think alcholism largely biological drug addiction may turn well doesnt mean ok us particular things tend wrong people get angry easily others tend arrogant others tend attraced women married someone else homosexuality view wrong wouldnt different things going follow god end one time another work overcome bad habits particular temptations cause us problems none us sit back say god made us way relax jesus said take cross daily concept dying self also appears throughout pauls letters seems suggest going things called accept pauls letters experience christians throughout history show us sin ingrained us battle lifelong difficult fact homosexuality difficult fight doesnt necessarily say ok maybe isnt place die self id like make sure think isnt fighting battle somewhere else rejecting concept christians fight deeply engrained habits sin
