costs less one part three thousand costeffective background phones happened allow existence wiretaps detectors could pick conversations phone line time law enforcement agencies come rely capability aid criminal investigations however powerful new encryption technologies threaten status quo making possible truly private communication small chip phone could soon make literally impossible overhear conversation without physical microphones either end order preserve ability law enforcement agencies tap phone conversations us government announced april developed begun manufacturing special wiretap chip placed future phones instead total privacy chips private development day att announced would use chips secure telephone products chip would created government supervision would given fixed indentifier encryption key periodically conversation chip would broadcast identifier info special law enforcement block law enforcement officers court order could obtain key corresponding indentifier special trust agencies could thereby listen future previously recorded conversations phone date concerns voiced plan security government wont disclose encryption algorithm many suspect government limit access way claimed track record previous governments inspire confidence point however paper neglect concerns ask instead whether new wiretap chip costeffective tool police investigation cheaper way society investigate crime force phone communications support wiretaps give police agencies money investigate crimes ways put another way would police agencies willing pay wiretap pay share full social cost forcing phones support wiretaps start answer question might compare current benefits wiretaps provide law enforcement agencies projected costs implementing new wiretap chip plan since current benefits easier estimate begin wiretap benefits latest year wiretap statistics available year wiretap installations requested requests denied figure include wiretaps obtained consent party conversation arrests resulted wiretaps started year arrests came wiretaps previous years arrests led convictions wiretaps phones vs pagers email etc regarding drug offenses requested federal authorities wiretap installation heard average calls incriminating among people cost average extrapolating installations reporting costs mostly labor thus total million spent wiretaps obtain arrests per arrest thus arrests least four times expensive per arrest figure one gets dividing billion spent police nationally total million nontraffic arrests thus million per year spent phone taps one thousanth total police expenditures divide million phone access lines country get cents spent per year per phone line two cents month general deter given class criminals combination perceived probability caught convicted expected punishment level convicted social value wiretaps amount would pay get criminal deterrence means unable wiretap particular suspects phone police might instead use hidden microphones investigate suspect ways police might focus suspects easily investigated without wiretaps might raise fine prison time certain types crime generously assume substitutes wiretaps would average twice expensive wiretaps annual social benefit phone wiretaps equal current spending level two cents month per phone line wiretap costs let us moment optimistically assume us government encryption scheme secure whatever private enterprise would offered instead protecting conversations spying ears neighbors corporations governments foreign domestic even need support wiretaps would add many additional costs build maintain communication system extra law enforcement blocks would added phone transmissions increasing traffic unknown percentage special process must used add encryption keys chips securely distributing keys special agencies must funded monitored chips designed military contractor whose design remain secret manufactured special process chip becomes nearly impossible take apart chips offered relatively high price peice lots private encryption systems supporting wiretaps would require none extra costs perhaps important government degree would least partially replace private marketplace evolution standards voice represented encrypted exchanged future phones widely believed governments less efficient private enterprise procuring products standards though may perhaps perform useful brokering role choose competing private standards much less efficient matter debate say pay twice much others might say currently total billion spent operating expenses us phone companies comes per month per access line compare wiretap value two cents per month see wiretaps raise average operating costs even much one part wiretaps cost effective doesnt even include extra costs phone owners pay encryption chips expensive course phones wouldnt encryption chips wiretap benefit per phone still argument still applies conclusion given dramatic difference total cost running phone system value wiretaps justify slightest modification phone system accommodate wiretaps modification required allow investigators attach clips phone wires wiretap support may reasonable consider substantial modification burden proof clearly proposing modification show costs would really less benefits consensus cannot obtain costbenefit estimate compromise might tax phones support
