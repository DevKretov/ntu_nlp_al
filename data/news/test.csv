result divulging incriminating evidence blocking restrictions private encryption preventing legitimate law enforcement make illegitimate law enforcement bunch difficult especially fishing expeditions without targets knowlege dont give right safe nonnegotiable clinton co know probably quietly developed thing figuring get far ram come consulted could roughly described us insiders cannot quietely impliment though ban schemes ensure exclusive use hence nice pr document try reassure everyone dont buy government really earned kind trust past future secure free one must keep government honest way make abuse impossible unlikely difficult even evidence would admissible think unless judge ordered think even interception crypttext without warrant would illegal cops cant record todays plain cellular calls ask judge hey permission listen tapes one could use information gained reuse keys saved last case finished means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm find evidence given judge would authorize tap wouldnt possible otherwise common manner abuse wiretaps past local cops might workable keep honest feds workaround somehow bet anyone really believe example government use scheme nsa cannot listen scanning keywords either easily defeated realtime via master key sure dont whole thing sounds like something eliminate need use oldfashioned police work build case past eavesdropping rather easy without court order think law enforcement community become bit spoiled resist changes require revert using oldfashioned detective work find somewhat surprising coming bunch cares much civil individual rights puts people first question put people first innards revealed one sure doesnt exist master key use nsa etc keyword scan etc conversations routinely monitor without specific court order remember cellular phone limitiation temporary bet far heard police telling people tapped nothing incriminating found keep simply keeping keys file next time awhile would quite collection kept especially folks deem disruptive get one key would reduce search space lot unless rsa scheme remember nixon years need court orders really slowed didnt unless escrow accounts government controlled fat chance see one ending say treasury justice could worth serious bucks folks get keys competitors clinton clipper descendent idea expanded used nongovernment encryption enough bucks would get one keys innards algorithm perhaps important concern given past government behavior problems worse course government uses clinton clipper argue restrictions unapproved encryption main concern us think camels nose tent etc yes major concern think think win usa use system dont even care cautious thats left dont catch really smart crooks anyway john gotti would retarded realize likely wiretapped glibly chatted away tapped phone murder plans thats hes jail hard believe true one expanded data storage encryption bet clipper accepted next agenda even hinted proposal read carefully expect argumet

expedition lawsrules may change future safeguards comes fed government safeguards pretty meaningless want doget something dont work hard give rather treasured rights establish bad precidents please price could hell pay later scheme succeed without laws forbidding people would fight lot harder like enough dropping called digital telephony proposal according rumours however meaning complex since still want get crypttext telco systems requires bit work people would fight laws forbidding say two years crisis situation must addressed drastic action added reasonable restriction bother someting hide etc please dont buy clinton clipper good make algrithm public many people exchange ideas examine rather isolated respected experts respected perhaps certain professor likes key banks would one

reading textbooks molecular biology genetics posting theological arguments like try watsons molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimores molecular biology cell starters remember question posed theological context god cause disease newborns answer likewise theological perspective less valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail fulfil criterion think misread meaning said god made genetic code perfect doesnt mean perfect certainly evolved since worse would please cite references support assertion

server ram anyone tried hacking x server locked ram get paged eg via call plock help performance ive one inquiry topic pointers plock function call hard evidence someone whos tried position give try thanks eric c claeys danny backx juan martin starting server joe english start lot clients xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner losh provided good explanation works summarized start x server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstations limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive experimented sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive even tried sleep exec startxclientsscript startxclientsscript sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm idea last one make sure xinit completely finished processing xinitrc settled steady state sleep expired clients launched yielded fairly comparable results stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use youll get speed increases loadup time one simple strategy choose small number fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also conserve server resources since fewer fonts loaded server farrell mckay joe english eg main xterm font x also twm set use x menus icons etc twms default font x since dont normally use x ive eliminated one font server oliver jones keep fonts local workstation rather loading nfs make extensive use r scalable fonts use font server resources file keep xresources xdefaults file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english one suggestion xdefaults xresources file try putting minimum number resources want available applications example reversevideo true separate resources individual

willing mail setup files inquirers method organizing personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every time starts doesnt seem make much performance difference might consider huge boon usability modifying applications resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch c style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered c style comments resource files simply silently aborted processing resource file loss preprocessing handy eg ifdef color enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs xvt find resources anywhere xdefaults starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey leedom possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients

least kingdom heaven matt faq full error must respond hope whoever maintains remove partisan theology brothers sisters new faith examining decalogue closely ive noticed fourth commandment pretty specific keeping sabbath day states th day saturday sabbath christian religions keep atleast go church sunday whats frequently asked question every time arises causes months debate let see answer directly basically law given moses part specific covenanent jews us arent jews arent part covenant argument early christian history whether mosaic laws apply gentiles became christians see account debate acts main question circumcision keeping sabbath would part well apostles concluded need become jews order become christians therefore rules circumcision apply us law known man revealed mount sinai rom notes law transgression sin exist sinai eden sabbath kept revealed sinai ex problem first covenant law promise undergirded god wanted perform lives people ignorance years slavery promised ever says new covenant based better promises heb rather away law god promised put laws minds write hearts heb including sabbath acts selective inclusion sabbath important jews circumcision attempt made away sabbath reaction would even strident recorded acts confuse weekly sabbath decalogue ceremonial sabbaths could occur time week part law ceremonial added transgression moral law gal israel stands gods people time god grafted gentiles roma says adoption glory covenants giving law service god promises belong israelites explanation paul makes clear born israel enough israel israel v gal says ye christs ye abrahams seed heirs according promise christians abrahams seed jews israelites physically criterion spiritually joint heirs jesus based promise god made people israelites christians agree ot laws apply us part specific covenanent jews also expect see similarity things god expected jews things expects us god however several ways dealing days common approach separate ot commandments moral ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply jews part specific mosaic covenant thinsg like kosher laws circumcision moral laws apply everyone commands part moral law except commandment sabbath believe people take approach would say specific requirement worship sabbath part ceremonial law general obligation worship regularly part general moral law thus christians free choose specific time worship people would probably agree wrong sabbath commandment ceremonial part law predates ceremonial laws free choose time worship even follow day worship origins pagan sun worship would rather give day god blessed sanctified hallowed exchange one church leaders agree biblical foundation see sabbath admissions socreligionchristianbiblestudy radical approach generally connected john calvin reformed tradition says law whole longer binding instead entirely grace behavior guided solely love portions ot law still useful guidance properly speaking legally binding us practice people take position believe safe leave christians without moral guidannce may longer law sinners safe us go situations principles guide us good selfjustification safe thus christians moral guidance things like jesus teachings pauls advice etc may precisely law serve much function largely content moral law previous analysis calvin would deny fixed legal responsibility worship specific day would say given human weakness discipline regular worship important care calvin theologian says guide god says law means keep law section law trouble sabbath commandment one god thought important enough say remember study word deeply note message longer condemnation law freed grace god cop pulls speeding court ask mercy judge throw book gives grace walk court saying go speeding grace grace drive within speed limit paul adds rom di make void law faith god forbid yea establish law wherefore law holy commandment holy good rom analyses specific day issue matter tradition worship sunday memorial christs resurrection theres debate acts shows early christian worship common analysis shows jewish christians continuing go jewish services sabbath specifically christian service necessarily held act shows worship first day sunday cor also implies gatherings day groups continue believe christians worship sabbath saturday bestknown seventhday adventists jehovahs witnesses argue act regular worship service special meeting see paul cor doesnt explicitly say regular worship service prefer implication fact careful study acts shows meeting saturday night sunday morning paul go worship service set long journey foot assos icor way equate lay store go worship service clear issue contested one pauls time see rom pauls advice careful judging issues like one person sees specific day mandated god another observes specific day honor lord believes worship free restrictions also honor lord believe sabbath still mandated argue paul referring sabbath worship note however col says something similar briefer explicitly mentions sabbath wrong sabbath days ceremonial law sabbath day moral law differences among christians use word sabbath originally term referred th day jewish day worship many christians use refer sunday day christian worship largely apply th whatever couple different numbering schemes commandment reformed tradition distinguishes sabbath observance mandated jews lords day free christian worship reference find nt rev also differences laws regarding day many christians support blue laws secular law church law setting aside day causing people spend worship radical antilegal approach sees regulations return jewish sabbath appropriate free christian worship lords day would prefer twist turn relying different arguments conflict rather obey simple request god loved enough die jesus died law could changed bother die order meet demands broken law need change law penalties law breaking means law immutable sin follow demands ceremonial laws always sin make false gods violate gods name break sabbath steal kill etc except disagree opinion weight placed next word god darius clear much needs said faq think pauls comments esteeming one day another rom probably needs said accept darius honor lord wish might equally accept esteem days alike similarly best honor lord however id like clear think theres unambiguous proof regular christian worship first day indicated responses passages cited difficulty passages actually something else look like talking nnregular christian meetings neither explicitly says gathered every sunday worship get various pieces information nothing aimed answering question act describes christians participating jewish temple worship christian communion services homes obviously temple worship sabbath acts example christians participating unfortunately doesnt tell us day christians met houses acts despite darius confusion described acts occuring sunday see reason impose modern definitions days start biblical text clear meant wording implies normal meeting doesnt say gathered see paul gathered breaking bread paul talked upcoming travel thats explicit enough really convincing similarly cor says first day set aside money pauls collection want believe gathered specially homes cant disprove obvious time congregation take offering would normally gather worship expected homes would reason mention specific day think obvious reading first day every week simply means every time gather worship think reason implications clear statements nt authors assumed readers knew christian worship clh

zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt

precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly

hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word kaaru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms
